## Supported Versions

The KubeSlice Worker Operator project is actively maintained, and we typically provide security updates for the latest release and the previous release. Users are encouraged to keep their installations up to date with the latest releases to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices

While we strive to maintain a secure codebase, users and contributors can help by following these security best practices:

- **Regularly Update**: Keep your KubeSlice Worker Operator installation and its dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest security fixes.

- **Implement Access Controls**: Limit access to the operator and its resources only to authorized personnel and entities. Employ Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and other access control mechanisms.

- **Scan for Vulnerabilities**: Use security scanning tools to regularly scan your Kubernetes clusters and the operator for potential vulnerabilities.

- **Audit Logs**: Enable and regularly review logs for the operator and your Kubernetes environment to identify any suspicious activities.

- **Third-party Dependencies**: Be cautious when using third-party libraries or tools in your deployment and keep them updated as well.

- **Educate Team Members**: Ensure that your team is educated about security best practices and follows them when working with KubeSlice Worker Operator.
